This is a integration and simulation of hardware 4x4 keyboard with Nexys A7 FPGA board.
where it consists of the digits from 0-9 and characters from A-F.
I have used verilog language to code FPGA using AMD-xilinx vivado tool.
and integrated 16 pins to c-Mod ports and verified the currect functionality of key pressed.

this key pressed is displayed in Seven Segment Display on FPGA board.
